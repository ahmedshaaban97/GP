transfer learning:-

what?

a machine learning model that solves a certain problem
can be used to solve another problem in another field 

why?
- There is a potential to make use of data labelled for another amputee to bootstrap a model for another amputee  likely will 
increase the accuracy of our models ---> better intention 

examples:-
1- data for spam classification in
one language can help spam classification in another language. 

2- learning a model on the medical data for one disease and transferring it
to another disease.

active learning:-

what?
is when we have limited labeled training data

why?
to save time labeling the data by

1-the small amount of labeled data is feed to the model to train on 
2-the model make predictions on the unlabeld data --> there is price associated with planning --> Jack will need to come so many times to the clinic ---> stand infront of screeen instructing him to make movements ---> Active learning algorithmically put a cost on labelling ---> It can be  necessary because it is expected to observe different EMG/ ....  due to muscle Atrophy 
3-the data with low prediction percentage will be confirmed by a human,
and enter the database as labeled data and it will be like feed back to the system
4-the data with high accuracy will be feed to the database and be part of the next training session
