-What
	UNDERSTAND signal !!!!!! noise or motion, intended or accident 
	focus on only certain movements performed?--->dream make all movements
	recognize the intention to perform different gestures, such as pointing and different types of power and precision grips.
	force, speed (proportional)
	--> user intention, how user communicates with device
	time to detect small? so machines respond----REALTIME
	movement is instictive without effort
	stop motion, start motion, change motion in the middle, maintain motion
    	no accidental movements -- intention true or false
	feedback? closed-loop, human-in-loop---> user is able to monitor whether the movement intention was decoded properly

not intuitive: the user has to provide distinct patterns of activity to trigger different functions supported by the device. Therefore, 
	to accommodate more functions, the user needs to produce more commands in a consistent manner. At the same time, 
	the decoding performance decreases as the number of classes to be discriminated increases. 
	long learning-curve--->high cognitive effort
	The device waits for the user to generate a conscious? trained? specific command--bad?

-Why
	--> intutive human- machine interface,,,working with a human-->intuitive control
	--> subject independent intention decoding-----personalized?

    	reduce cognitive and physical effort of training 
	NO/MIN TRAINING to produce a certain pattern of signals for each decision or type of motion
    	decrease rejection rate of prosthetic--not natural/intuitive foreign
	user-friendly/natural control---focus on end-user (humans)
