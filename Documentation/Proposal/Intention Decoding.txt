-What
	- understand signal: noise or motion, intended or accident, (stop motion, start motion, change motion..)
	- focus on only certain movements performed
	- recognize the intention to perform different gestures, force, speed (proportional)
	--> user intention, how user communicates with device
	- time to detect small---REALTIME
	- movement is instictive/natural without effort
	feedback? closed-loop, human-in-loop---> user is able to monitor whether the movement intention was decoded properly


-Why
	--> intutive human - machine interface,,,working with a human-->intuitive control
	--> subject independent intention decoding-----personalized?

    	reduce cognitive and physical effort of training 
	NO/MIN TRAINING to produce a certain pattern of signals for each decision or type of motion
    	decrease rejection rate of prosthetic--not natural/intuitive foreign
	user-friendly/natural control---focus on end-user (humans)
