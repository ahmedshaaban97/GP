Smart Control Strategy:
    -WHY?
               The idea is that we no longer want the prosthetic hand to feel like a tool, we want it to feel like an extension of the body.
35% of the amputees don't use their prosthetic hand regularly and about 10% reject their robotic prosthesis due to poor functionality or psychological issues.
During ordinary wear over time, the electrodes connected to the skin can begin to peel off, causing a buildup of electrical current on 
the area that remains attached, which can give the user painful shocks. Alternately, sweat can impede the connection between the electrode 
and the skin, so that the user feels less or even no feedback at all.so prothetics designer need to turn to smart control strategy to keep
the robotic limb seem more real and natural.
     -WHAT?
               Restoring meaningful sensory feedback is a challenging endeavor, which involves interfacing an artificial 
electronic system with the nervous system in order to convey information; make a limb with motor control, touch feedback,
and movement feedback. That should create the full sensation of ownership and control.
