 
We using machine learning to:
1-Cause intention decoding software to be subject indpendent and reducing the depedency of the model on the data.
2-Apply a real-time response for our prosthetic limb so the amputee feel free to use it.
3-Get an accurate feedback so the prosthetic limb seems more natural and real for amputee.
